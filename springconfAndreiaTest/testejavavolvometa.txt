Try to do as much as possible, don't give up if you cannot finish some of the items.
- Create a skeleton application using Maven and Java 8
- Configure a web application using Spring 4.2 and pure Java annotations configuration,
compatible with Tomcat 7
- Configure JPA2 with Hibernate and spring-data
- Implement the following ORM:
Department 1..* User
User *..* Permission
(Add the following attributes to all of the entities: id, name, description)
- Configure JSF2 with Primefaces
- Create JSF pages for list, create, update, delete, all of the 3 entities and relationships.
- Implement a REST endpoint (using json) for Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) Users
- Add a JMS destination that can receive XML messages representing a Department, transform
them to objects and persist in the database
(Create you own message format, if needed)
- Implement a good unit/integration test coverage
- Explain what would be the changes needed to make the application work in JBoss
- Create a documentation explaining all the necessary steps to execute/test your application


I needed to change the server to execute in jboss, so first I installed the jars, plugin, 
downloaded the version of eclipse to execute java8, and did the configurations asked.

So I did the classes, the sql, implemented the methods to do the list  and the crud. 
I did one Dao class to each entitie and one crud class to each entitie.
